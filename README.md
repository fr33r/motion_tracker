# Motion Tracker

This motion tracking software was built using Processing 2.1 for my CSE 464 Algorithms course as a final project.

## Research Paper

The [research paper](https://github.com/freerjm/motion_tracker/blob/master/freerjm_CSE464_Term_Paper_Final.pdf) is an officially formatted engineering document discussing various algorithms and procedures used to construct motion tracking software tailored for the domain of sports.

## Videos

There are two videos included, one [with the path](https://github.com/freerjm/motion_tracker/blob/master/vids/freerjm_CSE464_Motion_Tracking_Video_With_Path.mov) drawn to show where the moving object has traveled, and one [without the path](https://github.com/freerjm/motion_tracker/blob/master/vids/freerjm_CSE464_Motion_Tracking_Video_Without_Path.mov). These videos served as demonstrations to show the software's capabilities. The videos are in the format of `.mov`.
